# Hello world, I'm Tony!

I'm a multi-skilled IT Professional with over 28 years of extensive technical expertise and practical experience in planning, implementing and supporting IT infrastructures. Anything technical interests me, some would call me a techno-geek, and I love learning about new technologies and messing around with new code, hardware & software to see what happens.

* üè¢ I work at [Origin Storage Ltd](https://originstorage.com), where I have been for 18 years.
* :heart: My passions include all things tech, my family and Ancient Egypt.
* ü•á In 2024 I'm striving to increase my certifications on new technologies.
* üëç My new blog, [Technically IT Works](https://technicallyit.works), is now starting to get new posts on a weekly basis.
